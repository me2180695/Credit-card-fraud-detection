# Credit-card-fraud-detection
1.	Synthetic_data_generator: For a credit-card fraud detection problem, genuine transactions and fraudulent were modelled to arrive according to the Markov-modulated Poisson arrival.Transaction amounts (genuine and fraudulent) are normally distributed.Python code was written  to generate a dataset consisting with a total of 10,000 transactions.
2.	DiffMLAlgos_perfcheck: After generation of the transaction dataset, use ML algorithms (ensemble bagged trees, RUSboosted trees, logistic regression, and cubic SVM)from Sklearn package to find the algorithm that works best (max. modified f1 score,Recall (R) = Number of true positives / Number of actual positive samples Specificity (S) = Number of true negatives / Number of actual negative samples Then calculate the “modified f1 score” = (2RS)/(R+S).) in terms of predicting whether a transaction is genuine or fraudulent using transaction amount and time between transactions as features.
